Main goal is to improve the image based communication using cryptographic algorithms in machine learining
The development of wireless and mobile communidata transmission over open 
public networks is vulnerable to multiple r open public networks is vulnerable to multiple 
types of attacks. Encryption is the way information can be protected from hackers, so 
sensitive data can be protected by cryptosystems. With the rise of cyberattacks, 
encryption has become an important part of modern communication. But In the existing 
proposed encryption algorithms have long been proven to be insecure and pose a serious 
security risk to sensitive data.
 In existing systems, the following algorithms have been proposed: Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) incorporate an approach to detect the security level of image 
encryption. The following features extracted from cryptographic images are entropy, 
contrast, uniformity, peak signal to noise ratio, mean squared error, energy, correlation, 
and dataset labels Classified into three categories based on security level are: strong, 
acceptable, and weak to evaluate the performance. 
 The proposed algorithm uses image encryption algorithms for security level 
detection such as: Logistic Map, and Rubik's Cube Image Encryption, Lorentz Image 
Encryption, DNA Encoding by binding with Classifiers: XGB Algorithm enables fast 
algorithm selection and increased encryption security
